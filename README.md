Summary:
I have previously conducted exploratory data analysis on the titanic dataset and found that gender and passenger class was correlated with survival. 
My objective is to visualise this correlation and tell the story in a way that is easy to understand.  

Design:
I decided that a pie matrix would be a good choice to visualise the survival rate based on two variables. My feedback was very positive but with some room for optimization e.g. I changed the pie color to be more intuitive, perfected fontsize and customized the tooltips. 

Feedback:
-1st review: 
Two reviewers present. 
The reviewers easily understood the story but found the colors counterintuitive and suggested that I switched them around (the red and blue). Also, the legend text was too small.  
-2nd review:
One reviewer present. 
Found the tooltips a little confusing with variables like "PassengerId" and "Pclass". I decided to customize and simplify the tooltips.
